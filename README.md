## Hi there I'm shaula ðŸ‘‹

I'm a bachelor student at <b>Paris-Saclay University</b> stimulated by my past, present and future projects.
I mostly use <b>C++</b> but try to open up to other languages tho like <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b> or even <b>Lisp</b>.
After using the <b>SDL</b> and <b>Qt</b> libraries for quite a while now I'm currently learning to properly use <b>OpenGL</b>.
Feel free to <a href = "mailto: louiswilhelmrs@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you are into <b>3D Rendering</b> or <b>Digital Image processing</b> and have ideas to improve my projects.

### I'm currently working on :
 - [3D Rendering Pipeline](https://github.com/sh4ul4/Pipeline3D)
 - [Bitmap filters](https://github.com/sh4ul4/RetoucheProject)

### Here's some work I did :
 - [Text encode/decode UI](https://github.com/sh4ul4/Projet-LA)
